# Bamazon

Created during Week 12 of University of Washington Coding Bootcamp. The goal was to create an Amazon-like store front using Node.js and MySQL.
An Amazon-like CLI storefront built with mySQL, NODE.js and Inquirer NPM. The app can take in orders from customers, and deplete stock from the store's inventory.

**Deployment**

* Clone repo.
* Run npm install.
* Build database from mySQL. 
* At command prompt run node bamazonCustomers.js
* Run 'ctrl + c' to exit each mode

**What Each JavaScript Does**

* Print bamazonCustomer.js to display the available products in the store.
* Prompts customer which product they would like to purchase by *'item_id'*.
* An indication of the amount of stock available.
* It then proceeds to ask for the quantity of the product.
* An indication of the remaining stock in the *'stock_quantity'* table.
* Asks whether the user would like to make another purchase (Y/N)
