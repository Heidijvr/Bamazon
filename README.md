Created during Week 12 of University of Washington Coding Bootcamp. The goal was to create an Amazon-like store front using Node.js and MySQL.

* Clone repo.
* Run command in Terminal or Gitbash 'npm install'
* Run command depending which mode you would like to be on:
* Customer - 'npm run customer'
* Run 'ctrl + c' to exit each mode

**What Each JavaScript Does**

* Print bamazonCustomer.js to display the available products in the store.
* Prompts customer which product they would like to purchase by *'item_id'*.
* An indication of the amount of stock available.
* It then proceeds to ask for the quantity of the product.
* An indication of the remaining stock in the *'stock_quantity'* table.
* Asks whether the user would like to make another purchase (Y/N)
